#### Course Description:

This section of 2193 is an introduction to front end programming through the lens of visual culture. Students are asked to think critically about contemporary imaging + networking tools, techniques and practices while experimenting with interactive media. The semester is scheduled in sequence for an incremental understanding of contemporary web authoring practices. Using the web browser as a creative tool, students will explore responsive web development becoming familiar with: the [unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) command line, Git, Github + Github pages, and the fundamentals of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.Weekly readings and discussions will examine how networked media can be employed to question power structures, increase political action and create aesthetic experiences.

#### Class Participation:
By enrolling in this course and entering the classroom, each student makes the tacit commitment to participate in the class. Active class participation involves more than mere physical presence. Students are expected to be actively involved in the class, contributing positively to discussions, arriving on time having thoughtfully completed the reading, technical and creative assignments. They should take the initiative in discussion and projects, ask relevant questions, and contribute to the over-all learning environment of the class.

It is your responsibility:
1. To prepare for class by having read assignments, written papers and/or prepared projects
2. To actively participate in class discussion and activities
3. To take notes on discussions, presentations, and activities conducted within the class
4. To complete all course assignments, even if you are absent from a class meeting

Although you may want your laptop for every class, computers should be closed and mobile devices silent + not glowing during critique and class discussion. The mis-use of computational machines while in class will negatively affect your grade.

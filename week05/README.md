#### ðŸ’¾ Assignments 4 + 5
##### Pair programming presentation net.art project
With a partner, choose 1 artwork from either the [Rhizome's net.art Anthology](https://anthology.rhizome.org/) or [Chronus Art Center's WE-LINK online exhibitions](http://we-link.chronusartcenter.org/) to present to the class in a 7  minute presentation. Students should share a brief introduction to the artist(s), an explaination of the work and their thoughts on the expirence of the artwork. 
* You MUST create your [slide deck](https://www.google.com/search?q=slide+deck&oq=slide+deck&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l9.3609j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) using HTML, CSS + host on your class site. Each slide should be a relative link to another html page or a more sophisticated system if you choose. Use an external styling sheet to keep the styling of your presentation uniform. 
* Your slide deck website must include:
  * A clear wireframe and plan for execution
  * it's own directory + file path linked from your class site home page
  * Multiple HTML pages controlled by 1 external styling sheet
  * Flex and Grid Display on some portion of the pages
  * Some navigation with links to relative file path to go to the next "slide"
  * at least one [media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)
  * at least one instance of CSS [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) + one [id](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors)
  * At least three pictures and an "images" or "assets" directory to hold your media. A "pages" or "slides" directory to hold your pages.
* Post a link to your net.art Presentation Web Site (Slide Deck) 
* Remember this is a presentation to the class. We should hear from both people in the partnership. And if you want to somehow make yr presention interactive // inspired by the work you reserached - that's even better!

#### For Monday March 06:
Come to class having looked through [Rhizome's net.art Anthology](https://anthology.rhizome.org/) and [Chronus Art Center's WE-LINK online exhibitions](http://we-link.chronusartcenter.org/) 

Research which artwork you would like to present. Come to class ready to discuss with your partner and once you decide post a link to the work by your names [here](https://github.com/rebleo/webProductionSpring2023/wiki/Week-05#netart-pairs--projects). **You can not do an artwork that has been posted by another pair!!** 


#### Assignment for Monday March 13: No class - use this time as a code studio
Spend time with the work together and talk about the expirence of looking at it. Make notes - this conversation will lead to your talking points in the presentation. Take screen shots and/or recordings of yourself interacting with the work. If you each have a different experience of the piece - great! Show us and talk about the differences. Not simply "i liked it, s/he didn't" but actually what you each materially experienced on your different screens. 

We will not meet formally on Monday March 13th. Use the time to work on your proejct with your partner. You can use the classroom if you like or somewhere on the third floor.

#### Presentations should be uploaded and ready in advance of class on Monday March 20th.
